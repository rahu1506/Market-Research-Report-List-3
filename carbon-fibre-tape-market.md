<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fibre Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prepreg Tape</li><li>Dry Tape</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon fibre tape market can be categorized into two types - prepreg tape and dry tape. Prepreg tape is pre-impregnated with resin and requires heat and pressure for curing, providing a more consistent and high-quality finish. On the other hand, dry tape comes without resin and requires resin infusion or wet layup process during manufacturing. While prepreg tape offers superior mechanical properties and easier processing, dry tape allows for more customization and flexibility in resin choice. Both types cater to different needs and applications in the carbon fibre tape market.</p></p>
