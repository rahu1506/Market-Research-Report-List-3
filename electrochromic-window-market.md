<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrochromic Window Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer Laminate</li><li>All-solid-state</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrochromic windows are gaining popularity in the market, with two primary types available: Polymer Laminate and All-solid-state. Polymer Laminate windows consist of a thin film of polymer sandwiched between two layers of glass, making them lightweight and flexible. All-solid-state windows, on the other hand, eliminate the polymer layer and use solid inorganic materials, providing improved durability and performance. Both types offer the benefits of tint control to regulate light and heat entering a space, making them ideal for energy-efficient building designs.</p></p>
