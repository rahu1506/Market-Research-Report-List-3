<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Excavators OTR Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Excavators OTR tire market consists of two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are constructed with layers of cord running across the tire at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, providing greater stability and traction. Bias tires are built with crossed layers of cord, offering a smoother ride but less traction. Radial tires are typically more expensive but offer better performance and longevity, while bias tires are more cost-effective but may wear out faster. Both types cater to different preferences and budget constraints in the excavator OTR tire market.</p></p>
