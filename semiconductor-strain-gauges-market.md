<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Strain Gauges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Naked Gages</li><li>Backed Gages</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor strain gauges are used to measure the strain in a material by capturing changes in resistance as the material deforms. There are two main types of semiconductor strain gauges - Naked Gages and Backed Gages. Naked Gages are directly attached to the material being tested without any backing material, making them more sensitive to strain but also more fragile. Backed Gages are attached to a backing material, providing more durability and ease of handling, but they may be less sensitive to strain compared to Naked Gages.</p></p>
