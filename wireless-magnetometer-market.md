<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wireless Magnetometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scalar Magnetometers</li><li>Vector Magnetometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Scalar magnetometers measure the total strength of a magnetic field at a single point, providing a scalar reading. These are commonly used for simpler applications where precise direction information is not required. On the other hand, vector magnetometers measure both the strength and direction of a magnetic field, providing a more detailed understanding of the magnetic field's characteristics. They are usually used in more complex applications where precise directional information is necessary, such as in geophysical surveys or navigation systems.</p></p>
