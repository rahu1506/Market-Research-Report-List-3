<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pass Filter</li><li>High-Pass Filter</li><li>Band-Pass Filter</li><li>Band-Stop Filter</li><li>All-Pass Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electronic filters are devices that allow certain frequencies to pass through while attenuating or blocking others. The Low Pass Filter allows low-frequency signals to pass through, while attenuating high-frequency signals. The High-Pass Filter does the opposite, allowing high frequencies to pass through while blocking low frequencies. The Band-Pass Filter allows a specific range of frequencies to pass through, while attenuating frequencies outside that range. The Band-Stop Filter, also known as a notch filter, does the opposite by attenuating a specific range of frequencies while allowing others to pass through. All-Pass Filters allow all frequencies to pass through while introducing a phase shift.</p></p>
