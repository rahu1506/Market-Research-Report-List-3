<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrocarbon Passive Fire Protection Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-component</li><li>Two-component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrocarbon passive fire protection coatings are available in two main market types: one-component and two-component. One-component coatings are pre-mixed and ready to use, making them convenient for quick application without the need for mixing different components. On the other hand, two-component coatings require mixing of two separate components before application, providing greater control over the final product's properties. Both market types offer effective protection against fire for hydrocarbon structures, but the choice between them depends on specific project needs and preferences.</p></p>
