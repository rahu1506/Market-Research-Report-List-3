<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Quantitative PCR Reagent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dye-based Reagents</li><li>Probe-based Reagents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Quantitative PCR reagents are classified into two main types: dye-based reagents and probe-based reagents. Dye-based reagents involve the use of DNA-binding dyes that emit fluorescence when bound to double-stranded DNA, allowing for quantification of PCR products. On the other hand, probe-based reagents utilize specific probes that bind to the target DNA sequence and emit fluorescence only when the probe is cleaved, providing high specificity and sensitivity in quantifying PCR amplification. Both types of reagents play crucial roles in accurately measuring DNA amplification in quantitative PCR assays.</p></p>
