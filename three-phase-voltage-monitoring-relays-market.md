<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three-Phase Voltage Monitoring Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Over Voltage Relay</li><li>Under Voltage Relay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Three-Phase Voltage Monitoring Relays are essential for protecting electrical equipment from over voltage and under voltage conditions. Over Voltage Relays monitor the voltage levels in the system and trip the circuit if it exceeds a certain threshold, preventing damage to equipment. Under Voltage Relays, on the other hand, safeguard against low voltage levels which can also cause damage. Both types of relays ensure the reliable and efficient operation of three-phase electrical systems, making them critical components in industrial and commercial applications.</p></p>
