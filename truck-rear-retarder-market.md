<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Rear Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Retarder</li><li>Hydraulic Retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Truck rear retarder market consists of two main types: electric retarders and hydraulic retarders. Electric retarders use an electric motor to generate braking force, typically integrated into the vehicle's transmission system. Hydraulic retarders, on the other hand, use hydraulic fluid to create braking force by resisting the rotation of the drive shaft. Both types provide additional braking power to assist in controlling speed and reducing wear on the vehicle's traditional braking system, ultimately improving safety and performance for trucks on the road.</p></p>
