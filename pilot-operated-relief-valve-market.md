<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pilot-operated Relief Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Type</li><li>Non-closed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pilot-operated relief valves can be categorized into two main types: closed type and non-closed type. The closed type valves are designed to automatically close once the set pressure is relieved, providing smooth and precise control over the system pressure. On the other hand, non-closed type valves remain open even after the pressure is relieved, allowing for continuous flow through the system. Each type of valve has its own unique applications and benefits, catering to different needs and preferences in various industries.</p></p>
