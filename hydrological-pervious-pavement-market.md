<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrological Pervious Pavement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li><li>Interlocking Concrete Pavers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrological pervious pavement is a sustainable solution for managing stormwater runoff. Three common types include pervious concrete, porous asphalt, and interlocking concrete pavers. Pervious concrete is a porous material that allows water to infiltrate through the surface. Porous asphalt is made up of voids that allow water to pass through and be absorbed into the ground. Interlocking concrete pavers have spaces between them that permit water to filter through. All three types help decrease water runoff and promote groundwater recharge.</p></p>
